As an introduction: I am currently working through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp, and a very common first project for HTML, CSS and Javascript is creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe board, as a method of practicing front-end interactions. This is fun, but I'd like to take it one small step further, by making the game fully-functional – with a dedicated landing page that would serve as the home screen,two different modes of play, and nice little touches on the UI design to make it a warm, friendly game to play. 

This will not be a one-day project, and I aim to use it to practice prototyping in Adobe XD, version control in GitHub, my HTML5 coding and design skills, and my ability to write effective user stories. This is an independent project, so I will be the product manager as well as the developer and the designer, and as I dive deeper into it, I will wear many hats as I test, refine and learn. So here we go: 

The first-round user stories for this game are as follows: 
1. On the landing page, I can choose between "1–Player," "2-Player," and "Rules."
2. Within the Rules page, I can see all relevant rules for Tic-Tac-Toe.
3. Within 1-Player, I can play a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. 
    --> I can choose to play either an 'X' or an 'O.'
    --> Player one is 'X,' player two is 'O.'
    --> I have the option to go first, or to let the computer go first.
    --> I am not allowed to move while the computer is making its decision – and vice versa. Turns alternate. 

4. Within 2-Player, I can play locally against another player. 
    --> Player one is 'X,' player two is 'O.'
    --> It does not matter which person goes first, since this can be decided between the users. Turns alternate. 
    --> Only one player can make a move at a time. 

5. Once the game ends, I have the option to play again, or exit and go back to the menu.
    --> If play again is selected, the player who lost the last game gets to go first. 


Before getting started, it's also worth quickly touching on the color scheme that I have in mind for this game: 
– black background, white text lettering, and an accent of blue or cream.
- small tic-tac-toe logo, maybe something along the lines of (TTT) with one of the T's subscripted in the center
- font-families will be imported from Google Fonts, and I can choose an effective font pairing using fontsinuse.com, or another Typography resource
- Why Fonts Matter may also prove to be a useful resource for typeface pairing
